# mathmaticity
This is my mental math training website. The goal is to provide a data-driven tool for students to maximize the efficiency with which they practice low-level math tasks such as multiplication tables. The end goal is for lower level tasks to become automatic, thereby freeing up brainpower for them to focus on mastering higher level tasks in class.
